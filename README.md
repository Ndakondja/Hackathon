# Hackathon

#The code bombed out on the last day and you might not be able to run this, 
we can not connect to the smart contract when we try to submit transactions citing incorrect app id
even when the initial page to fetch it loads.

Due to time and lack of IOT devices, the producers' excess electricity has been hard coded and added to
the contract and the application are meant to be consumer-facing only and their transaction is to be 
recorded on the smart contract

But to run the app just cd into the front end folder and run npm start
